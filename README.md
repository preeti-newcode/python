# Python Basic Programs 🐍

🌟 About this Repository

This repository is a personal collection of basic Python programs created while learning and practicing fundamental concepts.
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills step by step, starting from small beginner-friendly tasks and gradually moving towards more advanced ones.

It is not just a list of programs, but a learning journey where each script represents practice with a different concept (loops, conditionals, recursion, functions, data structures, etc.).

🎯 Motive

To build a strong foundation in Python programming

To track progress while learning new concepts

To create a space that can be extended in the future with more complex programs and mini-projects

To help other beginners find simple, easy-to-understand code examples


🤝 Contribution

This is primarily for my own learning, but anyone is welcome to fork it, suggest improvements, or share more beginner-friendly problems.


👉 In short: This repo is not about showing finished projects, but about documenting the process of learning Python step by step.
